## Features

The list of features in active consideration.

### CLI Commands

The CLI commands should enable full exploration of the usajobs api, not just search.

### Pagination

The CLI should handle search jobs where the number of pages exceeds 1.

### Site

Go-USAjobs should have a github pages page to aid in discoverability. Posts
and articles should be updated with the new site for the same reason.

### Display

The CLI should produce tabular display output or means of easily exporting results
of job searches and other usages.

### Filtering

The codelist cli commands should support filtering to reduce output size
